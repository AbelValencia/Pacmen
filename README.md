# Pacmen
## Description
In this project, I created a web page that produces a PacMan with a click of a button using array methods and techniques for manipulating the DOM. Each PacMan after being created is going to move and bounce around the browser window. 

## How to Run
Just open the project on your browser and press the 'add PacMan' button you see on the screen to make a new Pacman. Press 'Start Game' to make it move. You can create as many PacMen as you want!

## Roadmap of future improvements
For future versions, I am planning to add ghosts in the game as the original game that all of us know.
